### Windows R package building

### Prepared by Osvaldo Espin-Garcia.
###	Date start:	January 28, 2019

### First install Rtools (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
### I also followed ideas from here (http://stat.sfu.ca/statgen/resources/r-tools-for-building-packages-on-windows.html)

### Unless otherwise specified, everything without comments should be entered in the command line (cmd prompt)


### Edit path in the session for the needed tools (add R as well at the end, note that Miktex should be added before R)
### here a note on how to set up paths in windows (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9546324/adding-directory-to-path-environment-variable-in-windows)


PATH=C:\Users\oesping\AppData\Local\Rtools\bin;C:\Users\oesping\AppData\LocalRtools\gcc-4.6.3\bin;%PATH%;C:\Program Files\R\R-3.1.2\bin

### Note the Rtools directories may change depending on your installations
