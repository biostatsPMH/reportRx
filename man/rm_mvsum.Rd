rm_mvsum(
  model,
  data,
  showN = FALSE,
  CIwidth = 0.95,
  caption = NULL,
  tableOnly = FALSE,
  p.adjust = "none",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{model fit}

\item{data}{data that model was fit on (an attempt will be made to extract
this from the model)}

\item{showN}{boolean indicating sample sizes should be shown for each
comparison, can be useful for interactions}

\item{CIwidth}{width for confidence intervals, defaults to 0.95}

\item{caption}{table caption}

\item{tableOnly}{boolean indicating if unformatted table should be returned}

\item{p.adjust}{p-adjustments to be performed (Global p-values only)}

\item{chunk_label}{only used if output is to Word to allow cross-referencing}

\item{markup}{boolean indicating if you want latex markup}

\item{sanitize}{boolean indicating if you want to sanitize all strings to not
break LaTeX}

\item{nicenames}{booling indicating if you want to replace . and _ in strings
with a space}
}
\description{
Multivariable (or univariate) regression models are re-formatted for
reporting and a global p-value is added for the evaluation of factor
variables.
}
\details{
Global p-values are likelihood ratio tests for lm, glm and polr models. For
lme models an attempt is made to re-fit the model using ML and if,successful
LRT is used to obtain a global p-value. If unsuccessful a Wald p-value is
returned. For GEE and CRR models Wald global p-values are returned.

glm_fit = glm(change_ctdna_group~sex:age+baseline_ctdna+l_size,
data=pembrolizumab,family = 'binomial')
